# Times-New-Xu

This repository contains HTML, CSS, JS code for our Software Engineering course project. 
I am responsible of front-end development in this project. 
This project aims at implementing a Chinese caligraphy convertor, which can convert user input to Xu's caligraphy. 
The user can use keyboard or mouse to input characters or write strokes.
